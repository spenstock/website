    <h1>6/22/19</h1>
    <p>So I decided to create editor's notes to talk about what's up<br/>
    The current plan is to create an arcade on this website, using the square blocks premade<br/>
    <img src="Capture.JPG" alt="website" width="500" height="333"> <br/>
    Probably spent 8 hours on the first game today, with probably 4.5 the day before that<br/>
    and 6 before that. So we're at like 18.5 hours which has gone crazy fast. <br/>
    Was up till 3 last night so I'm focused on this project.<br/>
    Most of this time was spent on the movement of the submarine, and how it moved with the mouse<br/>
    some works in progress were: <a href="demo1.html" target="_blank"> before mouse </a> and
    <a href="demo2.html" target="_blank"> before ship and basic detail </a>
    <br/>
    Currently, I don't like how it looks, as you can just explore the entire map by just clicking near the top and the bottom of the canvas.<br/>
    There is just too much range. The next step will be keeping the submarine in the center of the screen, and just move the background.<br/>
    I might get some hardware projects up here, stay tuned.<br/>
    Thanks for reading<br/>
